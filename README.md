Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for my professional portfolio which can be updated over time 
Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
I have included navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
I included a link to a PDF of my resume.
